## Idea
We would like to create a website that creates a community that brings together people who are interested in learning about mental health or need support for their mental health. The bigger picture is to have different communities and issues that people can join such as final week, unemployment, recruiting season, anti-asian violence. Users can find the group that they belong to and share their life to promote positiveness among the community.
